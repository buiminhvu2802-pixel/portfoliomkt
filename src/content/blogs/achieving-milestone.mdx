# From Accounting to Marketing: My Turning Point

Like many others, I entered university not because of passion or family pressure, but simply by chance. I happened to be accepted into the Accounting program at Foreign Trade University. It wasn’t something I loved, nor something I was forced into - it was more like fate, or randomness.

But once in university, I discovered something different. By joining the volunteer team, I found my true passion: marketing. The activities, the communication, the events - they all sparked excitement in me. My brother also helped me find part-time jobs related to marketing, which fueled my desire to pursue this path even more.

In my third year, I had to intern as an accountant at a bank. That was the moment I realized clearly: accounting wasn’t for me. I decided to step out of my comfort zone and took a digital marketing job running ads. The salary was low, and I even faced scams, but I kept going.

Eventually, I made a bold decision: moving to Saigon - where marketing thrives far more than in Hanoi. During my first year there, I learned so much. I gained practical experience, sharpened my skills, and grew both professionally and personally.
## The Milestone

From a “random” accounting student to a passionate marketer, this journey marks a milestone in my life. It wasn’t easy, but every step was worth it.

I want to keep experiencing more, learning more, and continuing to write my own story in the dynamic world of marketing.
